## A free domain for fans of tripleS

This aims to be another simple subdomain service to replace other link-in-bio options with a simpler vanity link. The infrastructure is entirely serverless, with Cloudflare Workers managing routing and the database with Workers KV, and GitHub pages hosting the front end. That being said, considering how simple this service is, the majority of the implementations used within this project are rather bare-bones. This is intentional for now, but the project may shift to a more robust design later down the road.
